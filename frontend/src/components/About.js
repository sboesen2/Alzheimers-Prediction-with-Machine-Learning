      <Typography paragraph>
        This tool uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict the risk of Alzheimer's disease based on genetic markers.
        It's designed for research purposes and should not be used as a diagnostic tool.

            Alzheimer's disease has a complex genetic basis. While some rare forms of early-onset Alzheimer's are caused by specific gene mutations,
            the more common late-onset Alzheimer's is influenced by multiple genes and their interactions with environmental factors.
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Key genes associated with Alzheimer's risk include:

        How to Use
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        Input the required genetic data in the provided fields on the Predict page. The tool will calculate a risk
        score based on these inputs. This score indicates genetic predisposition based on the markers provided,
        not a definitive diagnosis or prognosis.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginTop: '20px', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
        Always consult with a healthcare professional or genetic counselor for interpretation of genetic information
        and medical advice. This tool is for research and educational purposes only.
